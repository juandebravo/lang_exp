This is a basic proof of concept developed in october 2011 taking part of the [*I* *Language* *Experiment*](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23languageexperiment).

Don't use it in production :-)

# Basic social network demo

* Install [Ruby version manager (rvm)](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com)

* Install ruby MRI 1.9.2p290

    rvm install 1.9.2  
    rvm use 1.9.2 --default
    
* Create a project specific gemset 

    rvm gemset create lang_exp

    rvm gemset use lang_exp
  
* Install mongodb

* Clone git repository

    git clone git@github.com:juandebravo/lang_exp.git

* Go to language experiment directory:

    cd lang\_exp
  
* Install dependencies

    gem install bundler # install dependency manager
    
    bundle install # install lang\_exp dependencies
  
* Start application.

    bundle exec rails s
  
By default, application will run on port 3000 using mongodb database lang\_exp\_development. 
You can start in a different port using the switch **-p**, and a different database updating the config file **config/mongoid.yml**.
